# Changelog

All notable changes to WP Starter Theme are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
theme uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** — changes that can break a child theme (removed/renamed functions, hooks, filters, classes).
- **MINOR** — new features that keep existing child themes working.
- **PATCH** — bug fixes.

Add entries under **Unreleased** as you work. `npm run release` turns that section into
the new version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `composer.json`: the theme can be installed with Composer as `hnrk75/wp-starter-theme-parent` (installed in the `wp-starter-theme` folder).

### Changed
- `npm run release` runs a production build first, so every release contains fresh CSS/JS.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added
- Child theme support: the theme can be used as a parent theme. See the `wp-starter-child` template.
- Self-hosted variable fonts (Montserrat, Fraunces) registered with `fontFace` in theme.json.
- `wpst_google_fonts_url` filter to load Google Fonts if a site needs them (empty by default).
- `--measure` CSS variable for the readable line length of running text.
- Gray 50, 300, 600 and 800 in the theme.json palette.
- Recommended plugins widget: Two Factor, and a "Not activated" status with an Activate button.
- Swedish translations for missing and previously fuzzy strings, and for the theme description.
- `npm run release` and this changelog.

### Changed
- Colors are defined once in the theme.json palette and resolved in the browser, so a child theme can change them in its own theme.json. Hover colors use `color-mix()`.
- The theme's own files (`inc/`, CSS, JS) are always loaded from the parent theme.
- Line length is 42rem (~72 characters) instead of 70ch, and the ingress 45rem.
- Body text uses `hyphens: manual` instead of automatic hyphenation.
- The block editor mirrors the front end: same side padding, content width and line length.
- Links between the privacy and cookie policy pages are resolved to the pages' current URLs.

### Fixed
- Reactivating the theme no longer overwrites published or edited privacy/cookie policy pages.
- Centered and right-aligned paragraphs and paragraphs with a background use the full width.

### Removed
- Google Fonts are no longer loaded by default (GDPR).

## [1.0.0]

- Initial version.
